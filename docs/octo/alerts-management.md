# Alerts Management

As of this writing, Octo has three types of alerts: **cost**, **anomaly detection**, and **discount expiration**. We'll be discussing how to create alerts on each type. Before this, make sure you have at least one channel created in the Channel Management page.

## Navigate to the Channel Management Tab

- Locate the gear or cog icon on the top right corner of the app header, just beside your profile picture. You will see a curation of tabs
- Under the the `NOTIFICATION` section, click Alerts Management

## Creating an Alert

### Cost Alert

Cost alerts aide in monitoring your cost groups' daily spend. You can monitor multiple cost groups and send alerts to multiple channels per alert. There are two types of threshold available: **fixed cost** and **percentage compared to previous day**. For the fixed cost, you supply the amount you want to be the limit for the cost group/s' daily spend and Octo will send an alert to the designated channel one your spend exceeds this limit. As for the percentage compared to the previous day's spend, the number you input will be used to measure if the day's spend exceeds the specific percentage compared to the previous day's spend.

- Navigate to the `COST` tab
- Click `CREATE NEW ALERT` and a popup dialogue box should appear
- Supply the alert name
- Choose one or multiple cost groups and click `NEXT`
- Select if you would opt for the fixed or percentage type of alert
- Supply the fixed amount or percentage
- Select which channels you would like the alerts to be sent to
- Click `CREATE ALERT`
