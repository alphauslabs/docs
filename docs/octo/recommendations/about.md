# About Recommendation Feature
Recommendation is a cost optimization feature offered by Octo that helps users effectively manage expenses. Designed for multi-vendor environments, including AWS, GCP, and Azure, it currently supports AWS and GCP, with plans to extend to other platforms in the future. This feature also consolidates recommendations from AWS Cost Explorer, Cost Optimization Hub, and Trusted Advisor, etc providing comprehensive insights into cost-saving opportunities. It empowers users to make informed decisions and optimize their cloud expenditures efficiently.

## Sources
Our recommendation data comes from three main sources: AWS, GCP, and Octo-generated recommendations. AWS recommendations are derived from services like Cost Explorer, Cost Optimization Hub, and Trusted Advisor, while GCP recommendations come from the Recommendation Hub. Octo adds another layer by generating unique recommendations that cover additional insights not addressed by AWS or GCP (though GCP insights aren't available through Octo generated). This combination gives Octo users a broader spectrum of actionable insights to improve their cloud cost management strategies.
