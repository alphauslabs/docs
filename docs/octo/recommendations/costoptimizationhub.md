# Cost Optimization Hub

<p>
Cost Optimization Hub is a feature within AWS Billing and Cost Management that assists users in identifying and prioritizing ways to reduce their AWS expenses. It consolidates recommendations from various AWS services, such as Compute Optimizer, into a single dashboard. Octo retrieves all the data from the Cost Optimization Hub using an AWS API and displays it within Octo to eliminate the need for users to access their AWS console.<br><br>
