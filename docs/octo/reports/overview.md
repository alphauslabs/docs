# Report 

OCTO provides reporting capabilities that allow users to analyze cloud usage, track optimization implementations, and identify cost-saving opportunities across multiple accounts. Reports can be generated on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis and offer both pre-configured templates and customizable layouts to meet specific organizational needs. OCTO offers two main approaches to report creation:

### Fixed Report
Pre-configured insight reports with predefined layouts that are automatically structured based on your selected time period. This option provides a quick way to generate comprehensive reports with standard metrics and visualizations.
