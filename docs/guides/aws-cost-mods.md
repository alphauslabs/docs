# Adding cost modifiers to the AWS cost calculator using bluectl

!!! warning
    This guide is only applicable to Ripple users.

Ripple allows the modification of both `usage` and `cost` values in its AWS cost calculations through [cost modifiers](https://alphauslabs.github.io/blueapidocs/#/Cost/Cost_CreateCalculatorCostModifier). Since the modifier formula supports simple arithmetic, logical, and comparison operators, it is actually quite flexible.

In this guide, we will try and create cost modifiers to our AWS calculations. At the time of writing, there is no UI available yet for these APIs so we will use `bluectl` for the time being.

Make sure to install [`bluectl`](https://alphauslabs.github.io/docs/blueapi/bluectl/) first.
